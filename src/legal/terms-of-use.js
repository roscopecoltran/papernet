        website papernet.bobi.space (&quot;Papernet&quot;).
      </p>

        By using Papernet, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to any of the Terms, you cannot use
        Papernet.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can change these Terms at any time. There is a record of all changes to our Terms on GitHub.
        By using Papernet on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms. If you do not agree to them

      <h2>Content rights & responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        You own the rights to the content you create and post on Papernet.
      </p>
      <p>
        By posting content to Papernet, you give us a nonexclusive license to publish it on Papernet Services,
        including anything reasonably related to publishing it (like storing, displaying, reformatting, and
        distributing it). In consideration for Papernet granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree
        that Papernet may enable advertising on the Services, including in connection with the display of your
        content or other information. We may also use your content to promote Papernet, including its products and
        content. We will never sell your content to third parties without your explicit permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You are responsible for the content you post.</strong> This means you assume all risks related to
        it, including someone else&#39;s reliance on its accuracy, or claims relating to intellectual property or
        other legal rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        By posting content you did not create to Papernet, you are representing that you have the right to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you are posting a work that is in the public domain, used under license (including a free
          license, such as Creative Commons), or a fair use.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can remove any content you post for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can delete any of your posts, or your account, anytime, by contacting us.
      </p>

      <h3>If you break the rules</h3>
      <p>
        If it looks like you&#39;ve violated these policies, we may send you an email and ask you to explain what
        you&#39;re up to and why. Context is important, and we want to understand the big picture. If you
        don&#39;t adequately explain yourself or fix the problem, we may suspend your account or remove your
        content. We strive to be fair, but we reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content, without
        notice, for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may enforce, or not enforce, these policies at our sole discretion. These policies don&#39;t create a
        duty or contractual obligation for us to act.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also may change these rules at any time. We track changes to our rules on Github so you can see how
        they evolve.
